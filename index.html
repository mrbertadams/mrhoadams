    <p><strong>Biography of the Late Mr. Henry Ofoli Adams</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Early Life</strong><br>
    Henry Ofoli Adams was born on December 7, 1948, to Mr. Joseph Adama Adams of Osu and Madam Theodora Adukwei Allotey of Sempe both of blessed memory. He spent his early years in Lagos Town, now known as Accra New Town.</p>

    <p><strong>Education</strong><br>
    Henry began school in 1954 at Accra New Town Primary School. After passing the Common Entrance Examination in Primary Six, he gained admission to West Africa Secondary School (WASS). However, due to bullying, likely tied to his small size, his parents withdrew him and enrolled him in Accra New Town Middle School. Two years later, he returned to WASS, where he completed his secondary and Sixth Form education.</p>

    <p>He was a bright and confident student, representing his school in spelling competitions and taking an active role in sports.</p>

    <p><strong>Career</strong><br>
    After completing his National Service at the Ghana Broadcasting Corporation (GBC), Henry was retained as a radio technician. He served in Kumasi and Konongo before returning to the GBC Head Office in Kanda, Accra.</p>

    <p>In 1981, he moved to Nigeria, where he spent two years before returning home in 1983. Back in Ghana, he joined the Non Formal Education Division as a Ga language teacher. His passion for the language led him to write about ten Ga textbooks for basic schools, many of which are still used today. His contributions earned him a national award, presented at the Golden Tulip Hotel in Accra.</p>

    <p>Henry was also a respected private tutor, particularly in neighborhoods like Kokomlemle, Alajo, and Accra New Town. He became widely known as ‚ÄúTeacher H O,‚Äù a name that reflected both his role and the admiration people had for him.</p>

    <p><strong>Interests and Personality</strong><br>
    Henry was a man of many interests. He enjoyed reading, writing poetry, watching the news, and following football, especially his favorite team, Accra Hearts of Oak. He once participated in the popular ‚ÄúWhat Do You Know?‚Äù quiz competition and won, returning home to cheers and a festive welcome from neighborhood children.</p>

    <p>Known for always carrying a black bag full of Ga books, he readily shared them with anyone eager to learn. He was generous with his time and knowledge.</p>

    <p><strong>Family and Community</strong><br>
    Henry was a committed family man who played active roles at family events, often serving as secretary or MC. His strong tenor voice announcing ‚ÄúAgooo Awomei ke Ataamei‚Äù became his signature opening at gatherings, setting the tone for order and respect.</p>

    <p>He was intelligent, witty, kind hearted, and fair minded. A natural mediator, he helped resolve disputes with wisdom and care. His advice was sought and valued by many.</p>

    <p><strong>Church Life</strong><br>
    Henry was a devout Christian. He started in the Methodist Church, where he met and married his wife, Madam Esther Martins. Both were members of the church choir. After returning from Nigeria, he joined the Presbyterian Church in Accra New Town and served faithfully in the Men‚Äôs Fellowship, including a long stint as Secretary.</p>

    <p>Later, he became a member of St. Cecilia Anglican Church, where he worshipped until his passing.</p>

    <blockquote class="blockquote">‚ÄúWhen the day of toil is over<br>
    When the race of life is run<br>
    Father grant the wearied one<br>
    Rest forever more‚Äù<br>
    ‚Äî Methodist Hymn Book 975</blockquote>

    <p><strong>Legacy</strong><br>
    Henry Ofoli Adams leaves behind six children, nine grandchildren, and many extended family members. He will be remembered for his voice, his poetry, his lighter flicking at gatherings, and his unwavering commitment to education and community.</p>

    <blockquote class="blockquote">‚ÄúAnd I heard a voice from heaven saying, ‚ÄòWrite this Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from now on.‚Äô ‚ÄòYes,‚Äô says the Spirit, ‚Äòthey will rest from their labor, for their deeds will follow them.‚Äô‚Äù<br>
    ‚Äî Revelation 14:13</blockquote>

    <p><strong>Teacher H O, rest well</strong><br>
    Ofolleytse ‚Äì Yaawo jogbaan<br>
    Brother Ofoli, sleep on till we meet again. May Mother Earth rest gently on you<br>
    Amen</p>

    <p><strong>TRIBUTE BY SIBLINGS</strong></p>
    <p>A pillar on which we leaned. A big and mighty tree under which we all took shelter is no more! Whom do we turn to for wise counseling?!</p>
    <p>You were a family man who stood out at any family gathering be it wedding, naming ceremonies, funerals etc. H.O. will attend the ceremony before he will call to inform you. He always starts his sentences by saying ‚ÄúI know you are busy so l went‚Äù then the feedback will follow! That is him for you!!</p>
    <p>He was jovial and always made us laugh. A good story teller he was. He was a chorister in the Church Choir who didn‚Äôt joke with Hymns.
    H.O. was a Historian who had the family tree at the back of his hands.</p>
    <p>As a Teacher, he always shared books and study materials to his nieces and nephews. He would call and inquire on their education, after which he would advise that education was what we held on to, hence we should allow our children to go higher. He was an encyclopedia; no word was too big for him to spell, a gentleman indeed!</p>
    <p>We shall miss your loud voice that always called us to order ‚ÄúAgoo! Awomei ke Ataamei‚Äù</p>
    <p>We thank God for such a lovely person he bestowed to us. We shall cry no more for we know that; <br>
    ‚ÄúNo one lives to himself, and no one dies to himself, <br>
    When we live, we live to the Lord, and when we die, we die to the Lord, so whether we live or die we are the Lord‚Äôs‚Äù (Rev. 14:7-8)</p>
    <p>Sleep on big brother!<br>
    Yaa wo ojogbaa Ofooley Tse!<br>
    Bro. Ofoli May Mother Earth lay gentle on you!</p>
    <p><strong>AMEN üôèüèø</strong></p>

    <p><strong>A Heartfelt Tribute to Mr. Henry Ofoli Adams (1947 ‚Äì 2024)</strong></p>
    <p>With hearts full of love, gratitude, and immeasurable loss, we gather to honor the life and legacy of Mr. Henry Ofoli Adams ‚Äî a father, a literary mentor, an educationist, and a beacon of service to both his family and his community.</p>

    <p>Born with an unwavering sense of purpose and a deep commitment to service, Mr. Adams lived his years with grace, intellect, and a quiet strength that uplifted everyone who crossed his path. His was a life of intentional impact ‚Äî not in loud gestures, but in the consistency of his values, the clarity of his convictions, and the richness of his contributions.</p>

    <p>Though many knew him as a seasoned educationist and teacher, Henry‚Äôs journey was far more expansive. Before his decades-long service in education, he began his career with a passion for media and communication. As a sound engineer with the Ghana Broadcasting Corporation (GBC), he played a pivotal role in shaping public radio in Ghana. He wasn‚Äôt just behind the microphone or the control board ‚Äî he was in the field, pioneering the setup of radio stations that would go on to serve communities for generations.</p>

    <p>In particular, his work took him across regions ‚Äî helping to establish radio stations in the Central Region and the Bono Region, long before modern infrastructure made such work easier. These stations brought news, education, music, and national identity to people far beyond the capital, and Henry poured himself into this mission with characteristic excellence and humility. He believed in the power of communication to unify, to inform, and to inspire ‚Äî and he helped bring that power to places where it had never been before.</p>

    <p>At home, we were the lucky audience of his many captivating stories from those early days ‚Äî stories filled with dust roads, makeshift studios, and unforgettable friendships. As children, we would gather around him, wide-eyed, listening to tales of life beyond Accra. His stories weren‚Äôt just entertaining ‚Äî they were full of wisdom. He taught us what it meant to step outside your comfort zone, to adapt, to serve with courage and resilience even when resources were scarce. Through these stories, we learned the values of hard work, gratitude, and perseverance ‚Äî not from textbooks, but from the lived experiences of our father.</p>

    <p>Later, his journey continued into the field of education, where he would leave an indelible mark as a teacher and educationist. Working with the Ministry of Education, he shaped young minds not just with knowledge, but with purpose. He saw education not merely as a job, but as a sacred duty ‚Äî a way to empower the next generation. Whether in the classroom or at the policy level, he was a force for good, dedicated to lifting others.</p>

    <p>As a father, he extended his passion for learning to us. He took special care to ensure we excelled in English, both spoken and written. As a public speaker, we took inspiration from his many engagements, which culminated in all of his children having grown up to teach, with two of us taking up teaching as a full-time profession. He constantly provided us with books, newspapers, writing prompts, and lively discussions. He was never too tired to review an essay or debate a headline ‚Äî he believed words were powerful, and he wanted us to wield them with confidence and clarity. Because of him, we gained not just fluency, but the freedom that language gives ‚Äî to dream, to reason, to lead.</p>

    <p>His public service extended further ‚Äî as a District Assemblyman, he represented his people with humility, fairness, and deep-rooted principle. He listened more than he spoke, and when he did speak, he spoke truth ‚Äî often standing alone, but always standing firm. He didn‚Äôt need applause; he sought impact.</p>

    <p>A founding member of the National Democratic Congress (NDC), Mr. Adams played a foundational role in Ghana‚Äôs democratic journey. His involvement was guided not by ambition, but by a deep belief in justice, accountability, and the voices of ordinary people. He stood for what was right ‚Äî even when it was hard.</p>

    <p>Those who knew him knew of his love for words. A gifted writer, his thoughts came to life in the Daily Graphic and other publications, where his essays stirred thought and invited dialogue. He was also a master debater, whose sharp wit and reasoned arguments earned him accolades on radio and television.</p>

    <p>Yet with all these achievements, it is who he was at his core that we celebrate the most. A loving father, a thoughtful storyteller, a devoted Christian, a wise friend, and a pillar of his extended family. His love was deep and steadfast ‚Äî felt in the quiet ways: in the many books he bought us, in the stories he told to help us understand life, in the sacrifices he made so we could go further than he ever did.</p>

    <p>Thank you for giving us books as gifts instead of birthday cakes. It took us years to understand the wisdom in this gesture.</p>

    <p>We grieve the loss of a remarkable man, but we also celebrate the fullness of a life well lived. His legacy is rich ‚Äî not only in his accomplishments, but in the values he planted in us: faith, discipline, service, resilience, and love.</p>

    <p>Mr. Henry Ofoli Adams, your light remains. In the laughter of your grandchildren, in the pages of your numerous writings, in the airwaves of the stations you helped build, and in the hearts of those you educated, inspired, and served.</p>

    <p><strong>Rest well, Daddy. You gave the world your best ‚Äî and your best will continue to echo through generations.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>With all our love,</strong></p>

  <div class="container">
    <p><strong>Uncle H.O.,</strong> as we affectionately called you ‚Äî though technically a big brother to our parents, to us, you were more than just a senior cousin. You were a father figure in every sense of the word. You didn‚Äôt just show up at the big moments ‚Äî you were there for the little ones too, always watching out for us, checking in, offering guidance, and making sure we were on the right path.</p>

    <p>You played a lot of fatherly roles in our lives. Whether it was schooling advice, moral lessons, or just life chats, you made time for us. You didn‚Äôt treat us like ‚Äúthe next generation‚Äù ‚Äî you treated us like your own, and we felt that love deeply. Many of us grew up feeling your presence not just at family functions, but in our everyday growth and decisions.</p>

    <p>You made every family event feel complete. Somehow, you always arrived before the official invite even reached most of us! Then came the legendary call: ‚ÄúI know you‚Äôre busy, so I went‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚Äî no one could deliver that line quite like you. You were consistent, dependable, and always intentional.</p>

    <p>And oh, your stories! You were a gifted storyteller ‚Äî whether it was a funny memory, a history lesson, or some advice hidden in humor, we always ended up either laughing or thinking. Your voice, especially that unmistakable ‚ÄúAgoo! Awomei ke Ataamei!‚Äù, could instantly reset any room.</p>

    <p>You were our in-house encyclopedia ‚Äî words, facts, history, hymns ‚Äî you carried it all with grace. You reminded us constantly to take education seriously, and many of us did, because of your encouragement.</p>

    <p>We‚Äôll miss your warmth, your laughter, your steady guidance, and the way you made each of us feel seen. Thank you for being our cousin, our uncle, and truly, a father.</p>

    <p><strong>Rest well, Uncle H.O. Your impact is forever.</strong></p>
    <p><em>With love,<br>Your cousins ‚ù§Ô∏è</em></p>
